At no time is any personally identifiable information linked to any tip, rating or other contribution to the site. Your information and the contributions you make are completely separate. Every contribution is looked at and any information that may be traced back to another student or yourself will be omitted. We take anonymity here very seriously and every precaution known to keep this true is pursued. TUGS will simply be a place where contributors can submit anonymous reviews in the interest of upcoming students and those perhaps those who have done the unit previously out of curiosity. Once submitted and approved, all tips are stripped of any other metadata and is then just text associated with the unit/subject/module to guarantee your security. If there is any questions, please email TUGbyStudents@gmail.com";
