At no time is any personally identifiable information linked to any tip, rating or other contribution to the site. Your information and the contributions you make are completely separate and secured. Every contribution is looked at and any information that may be traced back to another student or yourself will be omitted. Once submitted and approved, all tips are stripped of any other metadata and is then just text associated with the unit/subject/module to guarantee your security. We take anonymity here very seriously and every precaution known to keep this true is pursued. The only link between you and a review is that it's known by your account what subject had been contributed to (by a saved id), not the exact contribution and its contents. TUGS will simply be a place where contributors can submit anonymous reviews curated for the best interest of the wider educational community, upcoming students and those perhaps those who have done the subject previously out of curiosity.  If there are any questions, please email TUGbyStudents@gmail.com";
